# Anna Monaco â€¢ Software Engineer

Pursuing a Computer Science major with an Engineering Entrepreneurship minor, I am a creative thinker and skilled web developer with years of experience. I currently work as a software engineer at Google, and I have lead web development for many startups and have expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, JS libraries like React, Angular, VueJS, and more.

Customer satisfaction is my utmost priority. Instead of simply completing a job, I strive to find innovative solutions to complex problems, think outside the box to make your website stand out, and work closely with my customers to refine my work to their desires.
